# 🦕 What is Deno?

### 📘 Overview

**Deno** is a modern, secure **runtime** for running JavaScript and TypeScript **outside the browser** — directly from your computer’s terminal.

> With Deno, you can write scripts, build tools, and even create web servers using just JavaScript or TypeScript.

## ⚙️ What Is a “Runtime”?

A **runtime** is the **environment** where your code actually runs.

JavaScript was originally designed to run **inside a web browser** (like Chrome or Firefox). But developers wanted to run JavaScript **outside** the browser too — for automation, backend servers, and command-line tools.

That’s where a **JavaScript runtime** comes in.

### 🧠 Analogy: Runtime as a Theater Stage

Think of your JavaScript code as a **script for a play**.

- The **code** = script
- The **runtime** = stage, actors, and crew that bring it to life

Without a stage (runtime), your script is just text. The runtime provides the lighting, props, and people needed to **make it run**.

Deno is one such stage — and it's built with modern tools and safety in mind.
