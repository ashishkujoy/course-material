# 🔁 What is REPL?

### 📘 Overview

**REPL** stands for:

> **Read - Eval - Print - Loop**

It's an interactive programming environment that reads your code, runs it, shows the result, and waits for more — all in real-time.

> Think of it like a calculator, but for JavaScript (or any language).

You type a line of code → it runs → you see the result immediately.

## 🧠 Why Use a REPL?

A REPL is perfect for:

- 🧪 Testing quick ideas or snippets
- 🔍 Learning how functions, variables, and expressions behave
- 🧰 Debugging small parts of your code
- 🧠 Building understanding without writing full programs

---

## 🧠 Analogy: Instant Feedback

Using a REPL is like **asking a question and getting an immediate answer**.

Imagine you're learning guitar:

- **REPL** = you strum a chord and hear the sound instantly
- **Full program** = you write a whole song, then play it at once

Both are useful — but REPL is perfect for learning and practicing the basics.

## 🚀 Using REPL in JavaScript

You can enter JavaScript REPL from the terminal using:

```bash
deno
```

## 🚀 Using REPL in Deno

You can also use Deno's REPL:

```bash
deno
```

Now whatever you write will be understood by deno not by shell. Write below code and press enter. This will display "Hello World" on the screen.

```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```

To exit the repl press `ctrl + d`
