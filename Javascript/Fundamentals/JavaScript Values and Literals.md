### ðŸ“˜ Overview

In JavaScript, **everything is a value** â€” numbers, text, booleans, objects, even functions.

A **literal** is the **actual written value** that represents a fixed value in code.

> Think of literals as the **raw ingredients** (like numbers or text), and values as the **ingredients once theyâ€™re used in a recipe** (code).

## ðŸ”  What is a Value?

A **value** is any piece of data that your program can work with.

Examples of values:

- `42` â†’ a number value
- `"hello"` â†’ a string value
- `true` â†’ a boolean value
- `null`, `undefined` â†’ special values

You can **store values in variables** or **pass them to functions**.

## ðŸ§± What is a Literal?

A **literal** is how you **write** a value directly in your code.

Examples of **literals**:

| Type      | Example               |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Number    | `10`, `3.14`, `-5`    |
| String    | `"hello"`, `'Ashish'` |
| Boolean   | `true`, `false`       |
| Null      | `null`                |
| Undefined | `undefined`           |

> If you type it directly into your code without using a variable or expression â€” it's a **literal**.

## ðŸ§  Analogy: Blueprint vs Building

- A **literal** is like a **brick** â€” itâ€™s a raw, fixed unit.
- A **value** is like a **wall made of bricks** â€” a result of combining or using literals in your code.
